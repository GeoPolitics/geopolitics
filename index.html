      Hello and welcome to GeoPolitics. The totally not degenerate Discord server
      where you can debate friends and people you have never met about any (and
      when I say any, I mean ANY) topic. The GeoPolitics system is extremely
      friendly to newcomers and its current members, and follows a very democratic
      system. GeoPolitics is a wonderful place where you can do literally anything
      you want unless the admins hate you for some reason, in that case you will be
      banned over and over. But listen, this server is great, and has nearly no flaws.
      Just remember, Beria is always based.
